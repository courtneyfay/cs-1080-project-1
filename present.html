            <h1>Wondering About What I Do In My Free Time Now?</h1>

            <h2>My Chosen Family</h2>
            <p>I currently live with my husband, Clayton, and our two cats, Denny and LaLa, in the New North End of Burlington, Vermont.</p>

            <h2>Current Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm spending a lot of my free time working on gardening and yard projects at our house. I'm growing native flowers,
                and just started my first veggie garden. I'm also taking a 6-month long gardening intensive at Ethan Allen Homestead.
                When the weather is bad, I snuggle with my cats and work on indoor crafts, like embroidery, collage card making, and refinishing furniture.
            </p>
            <p>On the weekends, I love going backpacking with my friends and have visited several parts of the Long Trail. Hoping to make it to the Adirondacks and maybe the White Mountains soon!
                This year, I've also gotten into lifting weights at the gym and am loving the challenge of it.</p>
            <p>I spend most of my traveling time visiting family now. We drive down to Virginia and Tennessee pretty often, so I spend a good amount of time on I-81. If you know of any cool places to stop along the way, please let me know!</p>

            <h2>Career Now</h2>
            <p>I have a couple of career experiments currently running. One of them is teaching CS1080 at UVM.
                I also started a website design business where I build websites for small and women-owned businesses. I'm currently participating in a business bootcamp that's helping me learn how to start my business and set everything up.
                I'm also working for a landscaping company as a gardener one day a week, which is great cause it gets me off my computer for a while!
