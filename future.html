            <h1>Wondering About Where I'd Like To Go?</h1>

            <h2>Future Family</h2>
            <p>My husband and I are hoping to have a couple of kids someday, and maybe also get a dog. Or a mini goat. I'm hoping we live in the New North End for a long, long time.</p>

            <h2>Upcoming Hobbies and Curiosities</h2>
            <h3>Bikepacking</h3>
            <p>I would love to get into bikepacking eventually. I love backpacking and think it's a really healthy form of exercise, but there is something kind of cool about how far you can get on a bike in a day. You could really see a lot that way.</p>
            <h3>Carpentry</h3>
            <p>Refinishing furniture is so fun AND it would be amazing to be able to build more stuff from scratch. I have so many ideas. So I can see me getting into carpentry or woodworking someday.</p>
            <h3>Bird Watching</h3>
            <p>I also think the gardening passion is going to continue and perhaps bleed over into bird watching. I love listening to them in our yard in the mornings when I'm drinking my tea.</p>
            <h3>Filmmaking</h3>
            <p>I would love to get back into filmmaking, perhaps starting with something short and kinda simple, like music videos. I used to make them for fun in high school and it would be great to pick that back up.</p>
            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>I honestly don't have many travel goals left at this point, but I would really love to see Montreal. It's right there and I still haven't been!</p>

            <h2>Future Career Goals</h2>
            <p>I could see doing some combination of teaching at UVM and running my website business, and I'm trying to figure out how to balance those things with starting a family. Will keep ya posted!</p>
